Module SciPy contains fundamental algorithms for scientific computing. 
It ables:
- FUNDAMENTAL ALGORITHMS
SciPy provides algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics and many other classes of problems.
- BROADLY APPLICABLE
The algorithms and data structures provided by SciPy are broadly applicable across domains.
- FOUNDATIONAL
Extends NumPy providing additional tools for array computing and provides specialized data structures, such as sparse matrices and k-dimensional trees.
- PERFORMANT
SciPy wraps highly-optimized implementations written in low-level languages like Fortran, C, and C++. Enjoy the flexibility of Python with the speed of compiled code.
- EASY TO USE
SciPyâ€™s high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers from any background or experience level.
- OPEN SOURCE
Distributed under a liberal BSD license, SciPy is developed and maintained publicly on GitHub by a vibrant, responsive, and diverse community.
